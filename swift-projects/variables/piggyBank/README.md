# Piggy Bank

You just returned from a trip to South America. The countries you visited were Colombia, Brazil, and Peru. You arrived back in your country with some foreign currencies from these three countries:

- Colombian Pesos
- Brazilian Reais
- Peruvian Soles

Write a Swift program in **PiggyBank.swift** that converts the amount of each foreign currency and displays the *total amount* in USD.

The final output should look like:

    US Dollars = $_____

## Tasks

### Creating variables

1. 
First things first, let’s declare three Double variables:

- `pesos` for Pesos
- `reais` for Reais
- `soles` for Soles

2. 
Give each variable an amount that you came back with.

3. 
You’ll need another variable to store the total amount you have in dollars. This is what we are trying to calculate in this program.

Declare a `Double` variable called `total`.

4. 
Run the code to make sure it’s bug-free before moving on!

### Converting to USD

5. 
Google the following conversion rates:

- from Pesos to USD
- from Reais to USD
- from Soles to USD

And write them down in your code using a comment.

6. 
Write an equation that solves for the total USD and save the value in `total`.

This will look something like:

*total = rate1 *pesos + rate2 * reais + rate3 * soles*

Note that `rate1`, `rate2`, and `rate3` are placeholders and should be replaced with the real numerical values for the conversion rates.

7. 
Print the total amount of USD.

Your final output should look like:

    US Dollars = $_____
