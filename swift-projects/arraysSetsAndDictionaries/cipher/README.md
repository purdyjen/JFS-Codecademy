# Caesar's Cipher

The [Caesar‚Äôs Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher) is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is named after Julius Caesar because it was used by the Roman Empire to encode military secrets.

To use the cipher, draw the alphabet in a circle like so:

Take every letter of your message and shift it three places to the right. For example:

- The letter `a` becomes `d`.
- The letter `b` becomes `e`.
- The letter `c` becomes `f`.
- The word `hello` becomes `khoor`.

Write a **CaesarCipher.swift** program that encrypts a message by shifting each letter three places to the right.

Let‚Äôs get started!

## Tasks

### Setting Up

1. 
First, declare an array named `alphabet` and store the English alphabet into it:

`"a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j", "k", "l", "m", "n", "o", "p", "q", "r", "s", "t", "u", "v", "w", "x", "y", "z"`

2. 
Because type is inferred, the `alphabet` array will hold the type `String`. For this project, however, we want the type to be `Character`.

The `Character` type stores individual characters whereas the `String` type stores a sequence of characters.

Modify the declaration of `alphabet` by adding the type `[Character]`.

3. 
Create a variable called `secretMessage` and give it the value of `"hello"`.

This is the message that we will try to encrypt.

4. 
Print `secretMessage` to see what we have.

5. 
Currently, `secretMessage` looks like `"hello"`, but we want it to be an array instead, like `["h", "e", "l", "l", "o"]`, so that we can compare its items with the items of the `alphabet` array.

Swift comes with a nifty array initializer, `Array()`, that can convert a text string to an array of `Character`s:

    var secretMessage = "brutus"
    
    var message = Array(secretMessage)
    // ["b", "r", "u", "t", "u", "s"]

Convert the string to an array of `Character`s using `Array()` initializer. Store the result in a new variable called `message`.

6. 
Print out the `message`.

It should output an array now!

### The Nested Loop

7. 
So now that we have two arrays:

- `message`
- `alphabet`

Let‚Äôs think about the logic for a minute.

We want to loop through the `message` and replace each letter with the letter that‚Äôs three places to the right in the alphabet.

Create an empty `for`-`in` loop that iterates through the characters of `message`:

- The iterator variable should be called `i` and start at 0.
- It should continue as long as it is less than `message.count`.
- Each iteration should increment by 1.

8. 
But how do we shift each of the characters in `message`?

Well, first, we have to compare each of the characters in `message` with each of the characters in the `alphabet`.

We need another loop inside our first loop. A loop inside another loop is called a *nested loop*.

Create an empty `for`-`in` loop that iterates through the characters of `alphabet`:

- The iterable variable should be called `j` and start at 0.
- It should continue as long as it is less than `alphabet.count`.
- Each iteration should increment by 1.

**Note:** We used a different iterator variable for the inner loop.

9. 
Next, inside the inner loop, we want to check whether or not `message[i]` is equal to `alphabet[j]`.

Write an `if` statement that compares `message[i]` with `alphabet[j]`.

If they are equal, change the value of `message[i]` to `alphabet[j+3]` instead.

10. 
Suppose the `if` statement found the matching characters and have done the shifting of the character in `message`, it‚Äôs time to finish the inner `for`-`in` loop and move on to the next character.

So in the `if` statement, add a `break` statement.

11. 
Now we have finished the bulk of the program, let‚Äôs print `message` after the nested loop.

### Bug

12. 
It may seem like we have a finished program, but not so fast‚Ä¶

Try running the program again with a new `secretMessage` this time: `"codecademy"`.

Oops, there‚Äôs a bug!

Take a look at the error message (scroll to the very top).

13. 
So what went wrong?

When the program tried to encrypt the `"y"` in `["c", "o", "d", "e", "c", "a", "d", "e", "m", "y"]`, it found its index in the alphabet, 24.

But when it looked up the letter 3 spaces to the right, which would be `alphabet[27]`, it threw an error because the alphabet only has 26 elements! It is ‚Äúout of range‚Äù.

To fix this, we can ‚Äúwrap around‚Äù the alphabet by using the remainder operator:`%`.

On the line where we replace the current character in message, change `alphabet[j+3]` to `alphabet[(j+3) % 26]`.

Now the new letter position will never go beyond 26.

### Optional

14. 
Congrats! You have created the infamous Caesar Cipher. üëè

If you‚Äôre up for a challenge, try to implement the following:

- The encrypted message currently comes out of the encryption as an array. Is there a way to convert it to a `String`?
- Sometimes we might need to encrypt a text string that includes capital letters. Is there a way to make sure all the letters are lowercased before the encryption process starts?
