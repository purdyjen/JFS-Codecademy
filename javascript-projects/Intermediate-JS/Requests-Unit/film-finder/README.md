## Overview
You’ve caught up on your list of TV shows and movies and want to get recommendations for what to watch next, but aren’t sure where to look. In this project, you’ll use your knowledge of HTTP requests and asynchronous JavaScript to create a movie discovery app that will recommend random movies by genre. You’ll be able to choose from several genres, and like or dislike a movie to get another suggestion.

Before you begin, you’ll need to [create an account](https://www.themoviedb.org/signup) on The Movie Database website. After you create your account and verify your email address, click on your user icon at the top right corner and navigate to the Settings page.

On the Settings page, navigate to the API section and click on the link to Request an API Key to register as a Developer.

You’ll be asked to enter some personal information like your address and phone number. This is pretty common. Many APIs use this information to keep track of how their data is being used. As a part of your registration, you will also be asked to provide a URL for the site where you will be using this API. Here, you can list` "https://codecademy.com"`. Check out these [instructions](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction) if you need further assistance with registering for an API key.

After you finish this project, feel free to challenge yourself to continue building it out. For example, you might recommend TV shows instead of movies, or change the information you present about the recommended movies. The possibilities are endless. Next time you find yourself needing new content recommendations, you’ll know where to turn!

### Tasks

#### Populate Drop-down Menu with Genres

1. 
Save the API key you obtained from the TMDB API to the `tmdbKey` variable. We’ll be making multiple calls to the TMDB API and will reference this key in the upcoming steps.

Remember not to share this API key with others!

2. 
Check the [TMDB documentation](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction) to find the API’s base URL, and save it to the `tmdbBaseUrl` variable.

We will append specific endpoints to this URL for each of our requests to the TMDB API.

3. 
For the next several steps we’ll be working inside the `getGenres()` function to fetch a list of genres from the API.

Check the [TMDB documentation](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/genres/get-movie-list) to find the “Genres” API endpoint. Create a variable called `genreRequestEndpoint` inside `getGenres()` and set it to the “Genres” API endpoint.

4. 
We will use query parameters to add more specificity to our request. Still inside the `getGenres()` function, create a variable called `requestParams` and set it to a query string where the key is `api_key` and the value is `tmdbKey`.

5. 
Let’s put together the URL where we’ll send our `fetch` request. Create a variable called `urlToFetch` and set it to a string that consists of `tmdbBaseUrl`, followed by `genreRequestEndpoint`, followed by `requestParams`.

6. 
Turn `getGenres()` into an asynchronous function that returns a promise. We’ll include our `fetch()` request in this function, and making it asynchronous will simplify handling the promise our API call returns.

7. 
We need a straightforward way to catch and handle errors if our `fetch()` request fails. Underneath our variable declarations inside the `getGenres()` function, add a `try/catch` statement. Leave the `try` block empty for now. In the `catch` block, log caught errors to the console.

8. 
In the `try` block, use `fetch()` to send a `GET` request to `urlToFetch`. Await the response and save it to a variable called `response`. We need to await the resolution of our `fetch()` call so that we can do something with the data we get back.

9. 
Still inside the `try` block, create a conditional statement that checks if the `.ok` property of the `response` object evaluates to a truthy value.

10. 
Inside the `if` statement of our `try` block, we’ll capture the data that we need to populate our dropdown menu. To get the requested data, convert the response object to a JSON object. Await the resolution of this method and save it to a variable called `jsonResponse`.

11. 
To make sure your code is working, log `jsonResponse` to the console inside our `if` statement. You should see a single object with a single key, `genres`. The value of `genres` is an array that lists TMDB’s genres.

Save the `genres` property of `jsonResponse` in a variable called `genres`. Log this variable to the console to confirm that it contains the correct information.

12. 
Return `genres` as the very last line of the `if` statement inside our `try` block of the `getGenres()` function.

When you run your program, you should now be able to see your dropdown menu populated with genres!

#### Get a Random Movie

13. 
For the next several steps we’ll be working inside `getMovies()` to fetch a list of movies based on the genre selected from the list of genres we returned in `getGenres()`.

Check the [TMDB documentation](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/discover/movie-discover) to find the “Movie Discover” API endpoint. Below the `selectedGenre` variable declaration, save this endpoint to a variable called `discoverMovieEndpoint`.

14. 
Like we did for `getGenres()`, we’ll create a variable called `requestParams`. Set it equal to a query string with two parameters. The first will be our `api_key` with the value, `tmdbKey`. The second parameter will have the `with_genres` key with its value set to the `selectedGenre` variable.

`selectedGenre` stores the returned value from a helper function (the `getSelectedGenre()` function in **helpers.js**) that captures the user’s selected genre.

Let’s also put together the URL where we’ll send our fetch request. Create a variable called `urlToFetch`. Set it to a string that consists of `tmdbBaseUrl`, followed by `discoverMovieEndpoint`, then `requestParams`.

15. 
Turn `getMovies()` into an asynchronous function that returns a promise. This will simplify handling the promise that our `fetch()` request will return.

Add `try/catch` blocks inside `getMovies()`, after our variable declarations.

In the `catch` block, log any errors to the console. In the `try` block, use `fetch()` to send a `GET` request to `urlToFetch`. Await the response and save it to a variable called `response`.

16. 
Still inside the `try` block, create an `if` statement that checks if the `.ok` property of the `response` object evaluates to a truthy value.

Inside the `if` statement, convert the response to a JSON object. Await the resolution of this method, and save it to a variable called `jsonResponse`.

Log the `jsonResponse` object to the console. To see your output in the console, you will need to `call getMovies()` after the function declaration. In the console, you’ll see a key called `results` that holds an array of all the movies in the first page of results.

17. 
Below our `jsonResponse` variable declaration in the `if` statement, store the `results` property of `jsonResponse` in a variable called `movies`. Log this variable to the console to confirm that it contains the correct information.

Return `movies` as the last line of the `if` statement. Later on, we’ll use this list to select a random movie as a suggestion.

After you check what `movies` logs to the console, remove the `getMovies()` function call. Otherwise, it will automatically execute every time you run your program, causing unexpected behavior later.

#### Get Movie Info

18. 
For the next several steps, we’ll be working inside the `getMovieInfo()` function to fetch the details of a random movie from the list of movies we returned in `getMovies()`.

Modify `getMovieInfo()` by having it accept a parameter, `movie`. Then, inside the function, create a variable called `movieId` that is set to the `id` property of the `movie` parameter. We will be using the `id` property to make another call to the TMDB API.

19. 
Reference the [TMDB documentation](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/movies/get-movie-details) to find the movie “Details” endpoint. Save it to a variable called `movieEndpoint` and replace `{movie_id}` in the endpoint with our `movieId` variable.

20. 
Let’s create our query params and the URL where we’ll send our `fetch()` request. Create a variable called `requestParams` and set it to be a query string with one parameter with `api_key` set to `tmdbKey`.

Create a variable called `urlToFetch`. Set it equal to a string that consists of `tmdbBaseUrl`, followed by `movieEndpoint`, then `requestParams`.

21. 
Turn `getMovieInfo()` into an asynchronous function that returns a promise. Add a `try/catch` block inside `getMovieInfo()`, after our variable declarations.

In the `catch` block, log any errors to the console. In the `try` block, use `fetch()` to send a `GET` request to `urlToFetch`. Await the response and save it to a variable called `response`.

22. 
Still inside the `try` block, create an `if` statement that checks if the `.ok` property of the `response` object evaluates to a truthy value.

Our response contains a single object with details about the given movie. Inside the `if` statement, convert this response to a JSON object. Await the resolution of this method, and save it to a variable called `movieInfo`.

23. 
Return `movieInfo` as the last line of the `if` block.

#### Display Movie

24. 
For this next set of tasks, we’ll be working inside the `showRandomMovie()` function to piece together our functionality and render a random movie’s info to the page.

Turn `showRandomMovie()` into an asynchronous function. Then, on the last line of the function, call `getMovies()`, await its return, and save it to a variable called `movies`. Since `getMovies()` returns a promise, we need to await its resolution so that we can do something with its return value in upcoming steps.

25. 
Below our `movies` declaration, call `getRandomMovie()`, passing `movies` as the argument. Store the returned value in a variable called `randomMovie`.

26. 
Below our `randomMovie` declaration, call `getMovieInfo()`, passing `randomMovie` as the argument. Await its return and save it to a variable called `info`.

27. 
Finally, as the last line of the `showRandomMovie()` function, call `displayMovie()`, passing `info` as the argument.

Run your program to see movie suggestions. Like or dislike each movie to be shown another random suggestion. Change genres to get different suggestions based on your interests.

28. 
Congratulations! You’ve finished building the Film Finder project! If you’re looking for additional ways to challenge yourself, consider the following:

- Check out the `displayMovie()` function in **helpers.js** to use the DOM to rearrange the layout of information on the page. Try displaying different types of information like cast, or release date.
- Create a way to store a user’s liked and disliked movies and display this list on the page.
- Our API call inside of `getMovies()` returns many pages of results, but currently our program only randomizes results from the first page. To randomize our results even more, update `getMovies()` so that `movies` contains results from a random page instead of the first page.
