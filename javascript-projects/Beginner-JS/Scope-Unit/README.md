## Overview:

As a seasoned athlete, one of your favorite activities is running marathons. You use a service called Training Days that sends you a message for the event you signed up for and the days you have left to train.

Since you also code, Training Days has asked you to help them solve a problem: The program currently uses the wrong scope for its variables. They know this can be troublesome as their service evolves. In this project you will make Training Days more maintainable and less error-prone by fixing variable scopes.

##### Code

    // The scope of `random` is too loose
    const random = Math.floor(Math.random() * 3);

    const getRandEvent = () => {
    if (random === 0) {
        return 'Marathon';
    } else if (random === 1) {
        return 'Triathlon';
    } else if (random === 2) {
        return 'Pentathlon';
    }
    };

    // The scope of `days` is too tight
    const getTrainingDays = event => {

    if (event === 'Marathon') {
        let days = 50;
    } else if (event === 'Triathlon') {
        let days = 100;
    } else if (event === 'Pentathlon') {
        let days = 200;
    }

    return days;
    };

    // The scope of `name` is too tight
    const logEvent = event => {
    const name = 'Nala';
    console.log(`${name}'s event is: ${event}`);
    };

    const logTime = days => {
    const name = 'Nala';
    console.log(`${name}'s time to train is: ${days} days`);
    };

    const event = getRandEvent();
    const days = getTrainingDays(event);
    // Define a `name` variable. Use it as an argument after updating logEvent and logTime


    logEvent(event);
    logTime(days);

## Tasks:

1.

Let’s begin by running the **trainingDays.js** file. In the console we can see that the program is broken!

Ideally, the `getRandEvent() `function selects an event at random. The `getTrainingDays()` function returns the number of days to train based on the event selected. The `logEvent()` and `logTime()` functions print the athlete name, event, and number of days to the console.

But poorly scoped variables are causing errors.

##### Expand days scope

2.  To avoid the `ReferenceError`, declare `days` within the `getTrainingDays` function, before the `if` statement.

3.  Run the program again: no error, but `days` is `undefined`! New `days` variables are being defined in the scope of each `if`/`else if` statement.

Delete the three `let`‘s within the `if`/`else if` statements.

4.  Run the program again: fixed! Now the `if`/`else if` statements are changing the original `days` rather than defining a new one.

##### Make name global

5.  The `log` functions–`logEvent()` and `logTime()`–use the same `name` variable. There seems to be a problem with the scoping; we can tell by the amount of duplicate code here! In addition to variables scoped too broadly, duplicate code can indicate that a variable may be scoped too tightly.

Let’s avoid this repetition by adding `name` as the first parameter for each function.

6.  Move the `name` variable to global scope.

7.  Pass `name` as the first argument to `logEvent()` and `logTime()`.

8.  Check that the program still works! Run it and check the output.

9.  Try the functions for another competitor. Copy and paste this code at the end of the file.

        const event2 = getRandEvent();
        const days2 = getTrainingDays(event2);
        const name2 = 'Warren';

        logEvent(name2, event2);
        logTime(name2, days2);

10. Run the program. The events are assigned randomly, but Nala and Warren are running the same events!

11. We see that the `random` variable is defined in the global scope. Each time `getRandEvent()` is called, it uses the same value.

At the top of the file, move the `random` variable from the global scope to block scope within the `getRandEvent` function.

12. Well done! Training Days is more maintainable and less error-prone thanks to your work. Run the program a few times to make sure the results are randomized.
