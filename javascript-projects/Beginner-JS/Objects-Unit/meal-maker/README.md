## Overview

A restaurant has hired you to create a function for their website that allows them to set a meal and price each morning for Today’s Special. Use your knowledge of getters and setters to make sure anyone who uses the new function can generate a meal and a price for Today’s Special without any embarrassing errors!

### Instructions

1. 
We’ll hold the meal, price, and their respective getters and setters in an object named `menu`.

In **app.js**, create an empty `menu` object.

2. 
The `menu` object will hold the meal and price of Today’s Special as properties and they shouldn’t be altered directly.

Within the `menu` object, create a `_meal` property with a value of an empty string (`''`). This will eventually hold the name of the meal.

3. 
Next, add a `_price` property with a value of `0`. This will eventually hold the price of the meal, and should also not be altered directly.

4. 
We know properties that begin with `_` should not be directly manipulated. But just to validate this knowledge, let’s test it out!

Below the `menu` object, directly manipulate the two properties by assigning `_meal` a number value and `_price` a string value.

Then, below the new assignments, `console.log()` the `menu` object to see how not type checking these values could cause confusion for a website visitor!

#### Add Setter Methods

5. 
To safely reassign the two `menu` properties, we can add setters that type check the values being assigned.

Below the properties, use the `set` keyword to create a `meal` setter method with `mealToCheck` as a parameter. Leave the function body empty for now.

6. 
In the body of the setter method, create an `if` statement that checks if `mealToCheck` is a `string`. If it is, return the object’s `_meal` property with `mealToCheck` assigned as the value.

7. 
Utilizing the same procedures as above, use the `set` keyword to create a `price` setter with `priceToCheck` as a parameter. This method should make sure the value associated with `_price` is always a `number`.

8. 
Below the `menu` object, set the values of `_meal` and `_price` using the newly created setter methods. Then, `console.log()` the `menu` object to check their functionality.

#### Add a Getter Method

9. 
Now it’s time to safely return the values of the `_meal` and `_price` properties in a readable form. Instead of directly accessing the properties, we can use a getter method that proactively checks if a meal and price have been properly set, before returning the values.

Below the setters, use the `get` keyword to create a `todaysSpecial` method. Leave the function body empty for now.

10. 
In the body of the getter, create an `if…else` statement to check if `_meal` and `_price` values exist (or are truthy values). If so, return a string telling potential website visitors what Today’s Special is. For example: “Today’s Special is Spaghetti for $5!”

If `_meal` and `_price` values do not exist (or are falsy) return the string `'Meal or price was not set correctly!'`.

11. 
Finally, use the getter method to `console.log()` Today’s Special.

Assuming you used the `meal` setter to assign a string, and the `price` setter to assign a number in task 8, you should see Today’s Special logged to the console.

If you want to extend your learning on this project, try adding an array of meals and prices to randomly set and get Today’s Special!
