# Math Magic

In this project, you will become a mathemagician and write a small program that performs a mathematical magic trick! It will involve performing arithmetic operations on an integer that you choose.

The instructions provided are general guidelines. Upon completion of the project, feel free to explore the code on your own.

1. Create an `int` variable called `myNumber`. Set it equal to any integer other than 0.

2. We will refer to `myNumber` as the original number from now on - it might be helpful to document this. Write a comment in the program that documents this.

3. Create an `int` variable called `stepOne`. Set it equal to the original number (`myNumber`) multiplied by itself.

4. Create an `int` variable called `stepTwo`. Set it equal to the previous result (`stepOne`) plus the original number (`myNumber`).

5. Create an `int` variable called `stepThree`. Set it equal to the previous result (`stepTwo`) divided by the original number.

6. Create an `int` variable called `stepFour`. Set it equal to the previous result (`stepThree`) plus `17`.

7. Create an `int` variable called `stepFive`. Set it equal to the previous result (`stepFour`) minus the original number.

8. Create an `int` variable called `stepSix`. Set it equal to the previous result (`stepFive`) divided by 6.

9. Print out the value of the last step. Then, save and run your code! What number is printed to the console?

10. Now, go back to your code and change `myNumber` to any other integer. Run your program again. Is the output the same? Itâ€™s math magic!

11. Great job completing this project! Want to keep challenging yourself? Recreate this project using only two variables: `myNumber` and `magicNumber`. Use your understanding of compound assignment operators to recreate the above program by only manipulating `magicNumber`.
