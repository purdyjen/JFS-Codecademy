# Java Variables: Mad Libs

Source:
From Codecademy's [Learn Java](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-java/) course, Variables Unit

In this project, we’ll use Java to write a Mad Libs word game! Mad Libs have short stories with blank spaces that a player can fill in. The result is usually funny (or strange).

Mad Libs require:

- A short story with blank spaces (asking for different types of words).
- Words from the player to fill in those blanks.

“Roses are Red” poem example:

For this project, we have provided the story, but it will be up to you to complete the following:

1. Create all the variables needed for the story.
2. Print the story with the variables in the right places.

## Tasks

1. Let’s create a comment that describes the program! The `/*` and `*/` are already in place for you. In between them, write a description that looks something like:

        This program generates a mad libbed story.
        Author: Laura
        Date: 2/19/2049

2. Take a look at the variable named `story`. It is set equal to a string that will contain our story. All of these variables will need to be declared and initialized before the code will compile without errors.

3. The story that we have provided is going to need a protagonist. Create a String called `name1` that stores the name of the main character.

4. You will need to provide three [adjectives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjective). Create three Strings, `adjective1`, `adjective2`, and `adjective3` and store different adjectives in them.

5. You’ll also need to provide one [verb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verb). Create a String called `verb1` and store a verb in it.

6. The story also needs six [nouns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noun). Create six Strings, `noun1`, `noun2`, `noun3`, `noun4`, `noun5`, and `noun6` and initialize them to your favorite nouns.

7. Our story needs another character. Declare a String variable called `name2` and initialize it to the value of another name.

8. Our story requires one number. Declare an `int` variable called `number` and set it to any whole number you like.

9. There’s one more variable! Declare a String called `place1` and store any place in it. This could be a city, or a town, or a country, or a planet!

10. Alright! It seems like we have all the variables we need. Save the file to see it run. Does it compile without errors?

11. Time to read the story! Use `System.out.println()` to print the `story` variable.

12. Put some whitespace in your code so that the `story` variable is hidden, and show your friends the code. Have someone else fill in the variables you have declared with the nouns, adjectives, verbs, and names that they like. Then, run the code to see a new story get told!
