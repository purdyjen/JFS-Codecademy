# Lingua Franca Project

From Codecademy's [Learn the Command Line](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line)

## Instructions

(Mac Users)
1. Delete the blank.txt file inside of lingua-franca. You don't need it, but GitHub doesn't like empty folders.
2. Copy all files from `copy_lingua-franca-don't-run-script-here` into the `lingua-franca` folder.
3. Open Terminal at `lingua-franca`.
4. Run `chmod +x mac-script.sh` to give the script the necessary permissions to run.
5. Run `./mac-script.sh` and see the magic of the script.
6. If something didn't work as expected, open `copy_lingua-franca-don't-run-script-here/mac-script.sh`, make any necessary changes, delete everything in `lingua-franca`, and repeat steps 3-6.
