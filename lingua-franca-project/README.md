# Lingua Franca Project

## Instructions

1. Delete the blank.txt file inside of lingua-franca. You don't need it, but GitHub doesn't like empty folders.
2. Open `copy_lingua-franca-don't-run-script-here/script.sh` in your preferred code editor and scroll down to line 68 and follow the directions. The necessary code for the script to work properly is dependent upon whether you're using a Mac or not, so you need to uncomment (by deleting # at the beginning of the line) the appropriate line of code.
3. Copy all files from `copy_lingua-franca-don't-run-script-here` into the `lingua-franca` folder.
4. Open Terminal at `lingua-franca`.
5. Run `chmod +x script.sh` to give the script the necessary permissions to run.
6. Run `./script.sh` and see the magic of the script.
7. If something didn't work as expected, open `copy_lingua-franca-don't-run-script-here/script.sh` again, make the necessary changes, delete everything in `lingua-franca`, and repeat steps 3-6.

## My Notes

I have made a minor note on step 14 and somewhat extensive notes on step 16.
